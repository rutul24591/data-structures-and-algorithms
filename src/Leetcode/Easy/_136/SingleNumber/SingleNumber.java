        136. Single Number

        Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one.
        Find that single one.
        You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

         Example 1:
             Input: nums = [2,2,1]
             Output: 1

         Example 2:
             Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
             Output: 4

         Example 3:
             Input: nums = [1]
             Output: 1

         Constraints:
             1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
             -3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
             Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

         Submission Details
             Runtime: 2 ms, faster than 61.94% of Java online submissions for Single Number.
             Memory Usage: 50.5 MB, less than 52.72% of Java online submissions for Single Number.

         Approach:
                Make use XOR operator.
                Store first element in result. Iterate over array starting from position 1.
                XOR(^) result & array[i] and store in result.
                Return result


        MORE on XOR operator
            Bitwise XOR (exclusive or) "^" is an operator in Java that provides the answer '1'
            if both of the bits in its operands are different,
            if both of the bits are same then the XOR operator gives the result '0'.
            XOR is a binary operator that is evaluated from left to right.

        Time : O(N) ; Space: O(1)
